### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Data Science faculty at the [University of San Francisco's Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS)](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science). I primarly teach Python and Machine Learning.

I'm active in the San Francisco tech community through volunteering and mentoring. I currently help out with [San Francisco Python Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/sfpython/) and [Delta Analytics](http://www.deltanalytics.org/).
